# dns-server

`dns-server` is a simple implementation of DNS server behavior. DNS is acronym
for Domain Name System, which handles the conversion of domain names into IP
addresses. BTW, this is not a complete implementation, it's just imitating DNS
server behavior.

## Usage

```
$ dns-server FILE
```

## Building

You can build `dns-server` by running `make` in the project directory.

```
$ cd /path/to/intended/repo/dir
$ git clone https://github.com/richiesuper/dns-server
$ cd dns-server
$ make
```
